# Project Overview

## Introduction

SORAT (Schedule On Route And Transit) is an Electronic Traffic Management System Platform designed to transform port facility operations. The platform leverages IoT, AI, and real-time data to streamline the movement of trucks, containers, and cargo, ensuring efficient, secure, and transparent port access and logistics.

## Business Context & Objectives

Port operations face increasing complexity due to growing cargo volumes, security requirements, and the need for operational efficiency. SORAT addresses these challenges by:
- Digitizing port access and scheduling
- Enabling real-time vehicle and cargo tracking
- Integrating all stakeholders on a unified platform
- Reducing bottlenecks and manual processes
- Enhancing security and compliance
- Providing actionable analytics for continuous improvement

## Key Features & Value Proposition

- **End-to-End Digital Scheduling:** No truck enters the port without a scheduled slot, reducing congestion and unauthorized access.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Live monitoring of all vehicles and cargo, with color-coded status indicators for quick identification.
- **Stakeholder Integration:** Freight forwarders, transporters, shippers, terminals, and security agencies collaborate on a single platform.
- **Automated Notifications:** Multi-channel alerts via SMS, WhatsApp, email, and in-app notifications.
- **Document Management:** Digital handling of permits, delivery orders, and compliance documents.
- **Performance Analytics:** Dashboards and KPIs for operational assessment and decision-making.
- **Scalability & Security:** Role-based access, data encryption, and offline support for remote or high-security environments.
- **Optional Add-ons:** QR-code authorization, barrier gate integration, vehicle weight sensors, and more.

## Solution Workflow (Summary)

1. **Detection:** Camera/IoT device detects vehicle at entry point.
2. **Recognition:** AI-based ANPR module extracts plate number.
3. **Verification:** Plate is checked against the transporter database.
4. **Logging:** All events are logged with time, location, and status.
5. **Notification:** Relevant parties receive real-time alerts.
6. **Dashboard:** Admins and stakeholders monitor live operations and analytics.

## Technology Stack (Highlights)

- **IoT Edge Devices:** Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, industrial cameras
- **AI/ML:** OpenALPR, YOLOv5, OpenCV, Tesseract for plate recognition
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python (Flask/FastAPI), PostgreSQL, Firebase
- **Frontend:** ReactJS/VueJS for dashboards, React Native/Flutter for mobile
- **Notifications:** Twilio, WhatsApp Business API, Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Security:** TLS, AES encryption, role-based access control
- **Cloud/On-Prem:** Flexible deployment options

## Unique Differentiators

- **Map-Based Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizes all port operations in real time, with intuitive color-coded status and queue management.
- **Comprehensive Stakeholder Ecosystem:** Designed for all port actors, from freight forwarders to security agencies.
- **Offline & Edge Support:** Ensures continuous operation even in low-connectivity environments.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Optional add-ons and API integrations for future needs.
- **Proven Workflow:** Based on industry best practices and tailored for port environments.

## Executive Summary

SORAT delivers a modern, scalable, and secure solution for port facility management. By digitizing and automating critical workflows, it reduces operational friction, increases throughput, and provides the transparency and control required by todayâ€™s port authorities and logistics operators.
