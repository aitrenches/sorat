# Deployment

## Overview

SRT supports flexible deployment options to meet the needs of modern port operations, including cloud, on-premise, and hybrid models. The deployment process is designed for reliability, scalability, and security, ensuring minimal downtime and rapid go-live.

## 1. Deployment Topology

The system can be deployed in various configurations:
- **Cloud Deployment:** All backend services and databases are hosted in a secure cloud environment.
- **On-Premise Deployment:** Core services are installed within the portâ€™s own data center for maximum control and compliance.
- **Hybrid Deployment:** Combines cloud and on-premise components, with edge devices operating at port entry/exit points.
- **Edge Devices:** IoT hardware and cameras are installed at strategic locations for real-time data capture and local processing.

## 2. Deployment Workflow

The deployment process follows a structured workflow to ensure a smooth rollout:
- **Provisioning:** Infrastructure and resources are provisioned in the target environment.
- **Configuration:** System components are configured for the specific deployment model.
- **Installation:** Core services, databases, and edge devices are installed and connected.
- **Testing:** End-to-end testing of all components and integrations.
- **Go-Live:** System is launched for production use.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring and support post-launch.
